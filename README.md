# Hillshade effects - The Finnish Edition

This R Markdown document is me applying the code in __Dominic Roy√©__'s [blog post](https://dominicroye.github.io/en/2022/hillshade-effects/) about the _hillshade_ shadow effects on relief maps. The twist is that the original maps Dominic uses are of Switzerland and I chose to use the map of Finland, since that's where I hail from.

The three big changes that came from the country change were as follows:

1. Had to search for the Finnish lake boundaries and found the data on the Finnish Environmental Institute [website](https://www.syke.fi/en-US/Open_information/Spatial_datasets/Downloadable_spatial_dataset))
2. Due to the different shapes that Switzerland and Finland have, I decided to move the legend to the right side of the map instead of the bottom.
3. And despite the lyrics in the popular song _Finland, Finland, Finland_ by __Monty Python__, Finland doesn't really have any _'lofty'_ mountains, so had to also adjust the elevations in the legend.
